Introduction:
"At our company, which operates a diverse fleet of aircraft, we faced profitability challenges due to various factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and labor market constraints. To address these challenges, I conducted an in-depth analysis of our database to find ways to increase our occupancy rate, ultimately boosting our average profit per seat."


Main Challenges:
1. Stricter Environmental Regulations: "The aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint, leading to more stringent environmental laws that raise operating costs."

2. Higher Flight Taxes: "Global governments are imposing higher taxes on aircraft, increasing the cost of flying and reducing demand."

3. Tight Labor Market: "A shortage of skilled personnel in the aviation sector has led to increased labor costs and higher turnover rates."


Objectives:
1. Increase Occupancy Rate: "Our primary goal was to enhance our occupancy rate to mitigate the impact of these challenges and boost profitability."

2. Improve Pricing Strategy: "We aimed to develop a pricing strategy that adapts to changing market conditions and customer preferences to attract and retain customers."

3. Enhance Customer Experience: "Providing a seamless and convenient customer experience, from booking to arrival, was crucial to differentiate ourselves in a competitive industry and foster customer loyalty."


Basic Analysis:
- "We initiated our analysis by examining data on planes with more than 100 seats, changes in booked tickets, total earnings, and average fares for various fare conditions."

- "Table 1 summarizes the aircraft codes and their respective seat counts, providing insights into our fleet composition."

Analysis of Ticket Bookings and Revenue:
- "We employed line charts (Figure 1 and Figure 2) to visualize the trends in ticket bookings and revenue. We noted that ticket bookings exhibited gradual growth from June to July, followed by stability until August. A peak in bookings on a single day significantly impacted our revenue."

Fare Analysis:
- "Figure 3 presents a bar graph comparing average costs across different fare conditions (business, economy, and comfort) for each aircraft. Notably, business class consistently had higher fares compared to economy class."

Occupancy Rate Analysis:
- "We calculated the average occupancy rate per aircraft, a key metric to maximize seat utilization. Figure 5 depicts the average booked seats as a percentage of total seats, highlighting aircraft with higher occupancy rates."

Impact of Increased Occupancy:
- "To gauge the potential benefits of raising occupancy rates, we projected the increase in annual turnover with a 10% higher occupancy rate (Figure 6). The results indicated a gradual revenue increase, emphasizing the importance of pricing strategies."


Conclusion:
- "In conclusion, our analysis of revenue data, including total revenue per year, average revenue per ticket, and average occupancy per aircraft, is vital for maximizing profitability. Strategies to enhance occupancy rates, optimize pricing, and prioritize customer satisfaction are essential for long-term success in the competitive aviation industry."

- "While increasing occupancy rates is crucial, it should not compromise customer satisfaction and safety. Striking the right balance and adopting a data-driven revenue optimization strategy will contribute to our company's growth and sustainability."
